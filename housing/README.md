# Housing for TTGO T-Beam
Sorry, i can't remember where i found the paraglide*.stl files. \
They probably came from Thingiverse.


The *scad files contain my design for a new strip of buttons and a case.\
You can stick the case with suction cups to your car side window. 
I use an external antenna with a magnet to put it on the car roof. 
The cable goes through the window.
The suction cups come from "Wibra", they are used for towel holders.\
The designs were made with [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/).
