# Housing for TTGO T-Beam
Sorry, i can't remember where i found the paraglide*.stl files. \
They came from Thingiverse.


The *scad files contain my design for a new strip of buttons and a case.


The buttons from the case broke off at first use, so i designed my own.\
Just break off the original buttons, clear the hole. Glue in the strip of buttons into the housing by putting some glue on the long slab.\

You can stick the case with suction cups to your car side window. 
I use an external antenna with a magnet to put it on the car roof. 
The cable goes through the window.
The suction cups come from the Dutch store "Wibra", they are used for towel hooks.\
The designs were made with [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/).
